This is a 42 project that consists of a simplified version of the printf function.

But how can I <b>run</b> this project? 

### 1 - First things first, you need to compile. Go to the library path and run:  
  
    $ make

### 2 - To use the library in your code include its header:
```C
#include "ft_printf.h" 
```
### ðŸ’¡ Tip! You can use scripts such as:

and that's basically it! :)
